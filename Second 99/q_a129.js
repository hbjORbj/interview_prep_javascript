/*
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), 

print the Next Greater Number for every element. 

The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, 

which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. 

If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
