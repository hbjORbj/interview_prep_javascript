/*
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
- The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
- You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Qs:
