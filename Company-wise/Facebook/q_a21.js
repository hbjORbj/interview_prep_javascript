/*
Interval List Intersections

You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj].

Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval [a, b] (with a < b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval.

For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].
