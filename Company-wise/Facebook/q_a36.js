/*
Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree root, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
