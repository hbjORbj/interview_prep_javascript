/*
Restore IP Addresses

Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained from s. You can return them in any order.

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers, each integer is between 0 and 255, separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros.

For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses and "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
