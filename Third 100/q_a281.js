/*
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. 

Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. 

And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. 

If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. 

And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.
